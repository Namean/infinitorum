This repo is a log of my discovery of mathematics, A heuristic approach.

This is to guide a user, through mathematics terminology, concepts, notation, relevance history, players, state, diagram, conventions, parlance of mathematics as a scientific art. With a familiary and joy of using the abstract art.

Create a mapping of concepts, subjects, implementation, algorithms, fields of Mathamtics (also called 'areas'), other scientific fields of stufy.

The idea is a user can query a particular subject, for example I'm intersted in real-time systems. Deterministic hard-real time systems.

There's an interesting problem that arises as software grows in complexity. Testing of that software tends towards an np-complete problem. I don't have much evidence for this other than 'A guy said a thing that one time, on wednesday. Fish'.
I'm hoping to show the usefulness of this tool via heuristic approach and building pieces as I go. 

There should be some time critical aspects of this as well.
