# infinitorum

This repo is a log of my discovery of mathematics, A heuristic approach.

This is to guide a user, through mathematics terminology, concepts, notation, relevance history, players, state, diagram, conventions, parlance of mathematics as a scientific art. With a familiary and joy of using the abstract art.

Create a mapping of concepts, subjects, implementation, algorithms, fields of Mathamtics (also called 'areas'), other scientific fields of stufy.

The idea is a user can query a particular subject, for example I'm intersted in real-time systems. Deterministic hard-real time systems.

There's an interesting problem that arises as software grows in complexity. Testing of that software tends towards an np-complete problem. I don't have much evidence for this other than 'A guy said a thing that one time, on wednesday. Fish'.
I'm hoping to show the usefulness of this tool via heuristic approach and building pieces as I go. 

There should be some time critical aspects of this as well.


"Human intelligence is measured on our ability to generalize" - unknown

I actually have some favorite mathematicians. Cedric Villani, Terrance Mckenna, Stephen Wolfram.

There's another fundamental aspect of this software in its ability to relate mathematical works, based on authors and topics.


For instance,

Stephen Wolfram and Jon Von Neumann 

Stephen works on Mathematica, and studies Cellular Automata
Jon Von Neumann I believe discovered the study of Ceullar Automata
